```html
<script>
    import {throttle} from "@sveu/shared"

    let smashed = 0

    let updated = 0 

    const smash_throttled = throttle(() => {
        updated++
    }, 2)
</script>

<h4>Delay is set to 2 second for this demo.</h4>

<button on:click="{() => {smashed++;smash_throttled()}}">Smash me!</button>

<p>Button Smashed: {smashed }</p>

<p>Event handler called: { updated }</p>
